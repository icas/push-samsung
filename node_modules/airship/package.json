It's largely an experiment of mine to learn more about event-based programming in Node.js.\n\n## Usage\n\nPlease see examples in the `integration` directory for usage. Given that this is such an early release, I'm very open to suggestion on how to evolve the API of this library.\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Urban Airship](http://urbanairship.com)\n* [Urban Airship documentation](http://urbanairship.com/docs/)\n\n## License\n\n### MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 James F.
