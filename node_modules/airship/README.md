# airship [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jherdman/airship.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jherdman/airship)

A wrapper for the [Urban Airship](http://urbanairship.com) API. It's largely an experiment of mine to learn more about event-based programming in Node.js.

## Usage

Please see examples in the `integration` directory for usage. Given that this is such an early release, I'm very open to suggestion on how to evolve the API of this library.
